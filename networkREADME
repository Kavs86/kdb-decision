Various functions used to generate matrices and find minimum paths, minimum spanning trees,
inspect routes and networks and help with finding optimal solutions to network problems.

genm - generates a distance matrix from a vector argument (the razed top right of the desired matrix)
genm1 - generates a distance matrix from a semi-colon separated single argument (the top right of the desired matrix)
tfd - generates a table with columns src,dst,dist from a text file with format a-b-num,a-c,num/nb-d-num, etc
mfd - generates a distance matrix from a text file with format a-b-num,a-c,num/nb-d-num, etc


edistm - generates a distance matrix from a set of coordinates (this will be the euclidean distance between each coordinate)

mst - minimum spanning tree. Builds a network connecting nodes so that the overall tree has a minimum distance. 
Useful for route inspection / optimising construction / travelling salesman type problems.

nw - network. Formats the result of mst and the input nodes into an easy readable network.
