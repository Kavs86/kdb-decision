Various functions used to generate matrices and find minimum paths, minimum spanning trees,
inspect routes and networks and help with finding optimal solutions to network problems.

genm - generates a distance matrix from a vector argument (the razed top right of the desired matrix)
genm1 - generates a distance matrix from a semi-colon separated single argument (the top right of the desired matrix)
edistm - generates a distance matrix from a set of coordinates (this will be the euclidean distance between each coordinate)
