Q)A two-player zero-sum game (with no stable solution) is represented by the following 
payoff matrix                  B plays 1   B plays 2
                     A plays 1    4           -2
                     A plays 2   -5            3
Find the optimal mixed strategy for each player and state the value of the game to that player.

A)The answer (for player A) involves solving a pair of simultaneous equations of the form
 4p - 5(1 - p) = -2p + 3(1 - p)
which will give us the optimal probability with with A should play row 1.
For B we would do the same with the negative transpose of the matrix.
