Dynamic Programming - the state at any point depends on the state previously in the program.
  
The question is how many ways can a certain target value be made using the coins in circulation (1p 2p 5p 10p 20p 50p £1 £2)?

The basic solution to the problem comes from the idea that the number of ways to make 
  say 13p from coins of value <= 10p will be the same as 
  (the number of ways to make 13p from coins of value <= 5p) + 
  (the number of ways to make (13p - 10p = 3p) from coins of value <= 10p)
  
Hence the program will be dynamic. If we think of the denominations in terms of columns, the previous column (<= 5p)
and the earlier state of the current column (<= 10p) will be used to generate more data on the current column.
Mathematically something like f10(n) = f5(n) + f10(n-10).

The argument of the perms function is the target value in pence. 
Eg. perms(100)=4563. There are 4563 ways to make £1 using 1p 2p 5p 10p 20p 50p 100p 200p
