Q)The differential equation dy/dx = ln (x+y^2) passes through the point (1,3). 
Use Euler's method with a step length of 0.2 to estimate the value of the particular solution
to the differential equation at x=2.

A)
//x0 is 1,y0 is 3,h is 0.2,x1 is 2

g:{[h;y;x]
 d:log x+y*y;
 y:y+h*d;
 y}

emfxxyh[g] . 1 2 3 0.2

Last value in list is the solution --> y=5.84 (2 d.p)

Note:Intermediate values give the estimated value at x=1,1.2,1.4,1.6,1.8 so we can inspect the functions behaviour.
