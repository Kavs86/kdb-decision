//At this point inspect the table. We want a route from s to t where "for" is not equal to zero.
//s-a is 10, a-d is 5. There is no non-zero path onwards from d but we can see that there would be non-zero "for" paths from c to t.
//Hence reversing c-d to become d-c would allow for a full path. This is done within the augflow function with `c and `d as
//additional arguments.

t:augflowswitch[`s;;`c;`d]t

//We can see from this there will be a route from s to t where "for" is non-zero, namely s-a-d-c-e-t so we use the augflowconnected
//function once more.

t:augflowconnected[`s;t]

//The furthest path of non-zero "for"s is now s-a-d-c but c-e and c-f are fully saturated and paths which have c as the destination 
//would be towards the source s. We have now reached the solution for maximal flow. Use maxflow to format the results:

t:maxflow t

//A table with the source node, destination node and the flow units through that node.
//Note the maximal flow through the network will be the sum of the flow from the source node s.
//This should be equal to the sum of the flow to the sink node t.
